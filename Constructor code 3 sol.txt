Walkthrough Task [Expected time = 15 mins] 
Write a program that creates a class called pizza. The data members of the class are size, toppings, price, thickness, 
extra toppings. Through the use of a constructor initialize the class object. Determine what is public and private in the 
class.

In the source file created in the project “pizza” write the following C++ code: 

class pizza 
{
private: 
int size, price, thickness; 
string topping; 
public: 
void setsize() 
{
cout<<"Enter size of pizza: "; 
cin>>size; 
}
void setprice() 
{
cout<<"Enter price of pizza: "; 
cin>>price; 
}
void setthickness() 
{
cout<<"Enter thickness of pizza: "; 
cin>>thickness; 
}
void settopping() 
{
cout<<"Enter toppings of pizza: "; 
cin>>topping; 
}
void display() const 
{
cout<<"The ordered pizza details are: "; 
cout<<"\nSize: "<<size; 
cout<<"\nPrice: "<<price; 
cout<<"\nTopping:"<<topping; 
cout<<"\nThickness:"<<thickness<<"\n"; 
}
pizza() //class constructor: cannot have a return type 
{
setsize(); 
setprice(); 
setthickness(); 
settopping(); 
}
}; 
void main() 
{
pizza obj; 
obj.display( ); 
}
